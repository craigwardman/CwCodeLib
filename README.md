# CwCodeLib
Useful utility classes organised as a Visual Studio Shared Project.

I recommend adding this as a submodule within your target project's repo (I put these in a lib folder). 
"git submodule add https://github.com/craigwardman/CwCodeLib.git CwCodeLib"

Then you can either:
A) Add the shared project to your solution and reference it (gets all files, but requires all references)
B) Or simply pick the files you are interested in by adding a "linked file"
